I did a cover song for the [_A Spray of Plum Blossoms_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Spray_of_Plum_Blossoms) (_一剪梅_). The song is also as known, or better known, as [Xue Hua Piao Piao Bei Feng Xiao Xiao](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=xue%20hua%20piao%20piao%20bei%20feng%20xiao%20xiao). It has become one of the latest Internet memes.

## Motivation

- This oldie Chinese song has become really trending in English-speaking countries, so I thought it'd be cool to cover it in my own way.
- My dad is a big fan of the original singer of the song and enjoys singing this song a lot. I thought it would be really cool to cover this song and show it to him.
- I just started to learn DAW (digital audio workstation), so doing a cover is also a great opportunity for me to learn DAW.

## Concept

I use this virtual singer called [AiKO](https://synthv.fandom.com/wiki/AiKO), who is basically the same as [Hatsune Miku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku) (初音) except that AiKO sings in Chinese. I bought the [AiKO sound library](https://www.anicute.com/product/8d45e4f7-58c7-455f-b0ab-d280524021f1) for USD \$60.

I did some rap in this song to add more color to this song. The rap lyrics is basically just rearranged lyrics of the original lyrics.

My wife recommended me to feature our daughter Valentina, who is 4 years old, in this song. I thought that's a really good idea, so I did it! In this cover song, you can also hear my daughter "rap" the signature phrase "Xue Hua Piao Piao Bei Feng Xiao Xiao" throughout the song. It's pretty fun!

## Production

Here is a brief summary of how I produced this song.

### Music

1. Googled and downloaded a [instrument MIDI](https://www.midishow.com/tool/mididy?id=42526) for this song. Import the MIDI file (`.mid` file) to Logic Pro.
1. Changed the temp from 70 bpm (beats per minute) to 90 bpm because I wanted the song to be more exciting.
1. Changed and the key from A♭m to E♭m so that it is more suitable for a female singer.
1. Edited the drum track because I found it too busy in the original song/MIDI.
1. Exported the melody track from Logic Pro to a MIDI file, and imported it to [Synthesizer V](https://dreamtonics.com/synthesizerv-gen1/en/).
1. Loaded up [AiKO sound library](https://www.anicute.com/product/8d45e4f7-58c7-455f-b0ab-d280524021f1) in Synthesizer V, and enter lyrics word-by-word for each note.
1. Make vibrato with Synthesizer V pitch editor. Vibrato is used a lot in this song.
1. Render the AiKO's vocal to an audio file (`.wav` file) and import it to Logic Pro. Now we have instruments and vocal.
1. I wrote some Chinese rap lyrics based on the original lyrics, and did some simple rap.
1. My wife and I taught our daughter the magic phrase "Xue Hua Piao Piao Bei Feng Xiao Xiao" and I recorded her "rap".
1. Did some simple EQ, compression, and reverb. Use loudness meter to make sure that the final audio is never too loud.
1. Finally, bounced all the tracks in Logic Pro into one `.mp3` file.

### Video

1. Imported the `.mp3` audio file to Final Cut Pro.
1. Imported background images (the snow photo is from [upsplash](https://unsplash.com/)).
1. Typed the lyrics and credits.
1. Finally, exported the video and uploaded to YouTube.
